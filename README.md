# Automation Portfolio - Ready

This is a minimal Create React App project scaffold with Tailwind CSS and a single-page portfolio focused on automation testing.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Notes:
- This project is intended to be used with Create React App tooling. If you prefer Vite/Next.js I can prepare that instead.
- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and PostCSS.
